# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import the math module.
### Step 2: 
Assign the value of variable.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](https://github.com/BhumireddyLakshmivardhanreddy/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/assets/148514637/c538c0d9-1a9c-4ce2-9b7e-7dceeb9841f8)
### Step 4: 
Print the distance.
### Step 5:
End the program. 
### PROGRAM:
 ```Python

x1=4
x2=10
y1=2
y2=6
distance=((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)**(1/2)
print("{:0.2f}".format(distance))

 ``` 


### OUTPUT:
![output](https://github.com/BhumireddyLakshmivardhanreddy/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/assets/148514637/38884032-2ad5-4a76-b5a6-300f5ac552f5)



### RESULT:
Thus the program to find the distance between two points is written and verified using python programming.
