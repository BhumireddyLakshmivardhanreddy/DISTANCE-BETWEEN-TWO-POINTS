# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import the math module.
### Step 2: 
Assign the value of variable.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Print the distance.
### Step 5:
End the program. 
### PROGRAM:
 ```Python

x1=4
x2=10
y1=2
y2=6
distance=((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)**(1/2)
print("{:0.2f}".format(distance))

 ``` 


### OUTPUT:
